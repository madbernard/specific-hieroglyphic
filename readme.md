There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Specific Heiroglyphics ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
View your name in heiroglyphics:  *as an actual ancient Egyptian scribe would write it!*

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
This "your name in heiroglyphics" site gives you the best-looking, most historically accurate experience on the internet!  It offers you choices when there are several possible symbols with the same sound!  It arranges the heiroglyphics like an ancient scribe would, instead of just lining them up like English letters!  It tells you the meanings of the heiroglyphics, and how they would be pronounced!

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
Current heiroglyphic name generators aren't very accurate, sound-wise.  Have you noticed how they provide the same glyph for many different sounds...  e, i, and l are all reed?

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

This site uses the latest scholarship and technology to make your name pronounceable to Ancient Egyptians...  While also making it look great!

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

"Let's be specific, here:  heiroglyphics are cool, and the better they look, the cooler they are."  -- Madeline Bernard

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

Just go to the website and put your name in the box, making choices from the sliders until you're happy!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

"This is definitely the site that makes my name look most like something that I could find carved on the base of an Egyptian statue."  -- Margaret Customer

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
